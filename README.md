This video explains the operation of the 4-Switch Buck-Boost DC-DC Converter. 
In the first part the topology is presented and its different operating modes are explained. 
The video also presents the main characteristics of the converter and its basic control.

In the second part we will see some details about the implementation of the 4-switch buck-boost 
dc-dc converter and we show a design example for the case of variable input voltage and regulated output voltage. 
LTspice simulations are shown to illustrate the operation of the converter.
